# Benchmarking in LLMs

**Benchmarking in LLMs** means **evaluating and comparing the performance** of Large Language Models using a set of **standard tests, tasks, and metrics**.  
It helps you understand how good a model is at reasoning, coding, math, knowledge recall, safety, etc.

---

## ✅ Simple Definition
Benchmarking = **Testing an LLM across multiple tasks** to measure how accurate, fast, and reliable it is compared to other models.

---

## ✅ Why Benchmarking is Needed
LLMs differ in:
- Accuracy  
- Reasoning ability  
- Hallucination rate  
- Speed & latency  
- Cost  
- Safety  

Benchmarking gives a **fair, repeatable way** to compare them.

## ✅ Common Areas LLMs Are Benchmarked In

### 1. General Knowledge & QA
- MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)  
- ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)  
- TriviaQA  

### 2. Reasoning
- GSM8K (Math Word Problems)  
- MATH Benchmark  
- BIG-Bench Hard (BBH)  
- GPQA (Graduate-Level Reasoning)  

### 3. Coding
- HumanEval  
- MBPP (Multi-lingual Programming Problems)  
- Codeforces Difficulty Tiers  

### 4. Safety & Alignment
- TruthfulQA  
- HELM safety tests  
- Red-teaming datasets  

### 5. Retrieval / RAG Benchmarks
- BEIR  
- MSMARCO  
- HotpotQA  
- RAGAS (for evaluating RAG pipelines)  

### 6. Multimodal Benchmarks
(for models with vision/audio)
- MMBench  
- VQA (Visual Question Answering)
