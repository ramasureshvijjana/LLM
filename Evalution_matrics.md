## What is Perplexity

## Perplexity Values

- **Perplexity = 1** → The LLM is perfectly confident and makes no mistakes.  
  It predicts the correct next word with 100% certainty.  
  *Example: If you ask “The sun rises in the ___”, it’s sure the answer is **east***.

- **Perplexity = 10** → The LLM is 10 times more “confused.”  
  It’s much less confident and spreads probability across many possible words.  
  *Example: It isn’t sure whether to say **east, morning, sky, world,** etc.*

👉 **Lower perplexity = better, more certain predictions**  
👉 **Higher perplexity = more confused, less accurate predictions**
